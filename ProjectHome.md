A Delphi based, feature rich Plugin framework to break monolithic executable into smaller modules (could be developed using Delphi or C++ or Java C# or any other compatible language). The main features of this framework are as below:
> a) The user can let all available modules loaded and configured at run time or have finer control in loading or unloading desired modules.
> b) The modules would have all the capabilities of Delphi executable including full GUI abilities, multi-thread support and all else that any normal Delphi based application can do.
> c) The plugins would be able to share DB Connections, thread-pools and other resources across plugins boundaries.
> d) The plugins can define their own dependency chain or pre-requisites (including dependencies on other plugins)
